## # Project README

This project aims to provide a comprehensive guide to building a frontend application that integrates the Google Maps API with React. The guide covers everything from setting up the project to adding advanced features like geocoding and routing.

## Introduction

The article will walk through the process of integrating Google Maps API into a React application to create interactive maps with location-based services. The guide will cover setting up the project, creating UI components, creating a map component, and adding features like custom markers, distance between two points, search for a location, and custom overlays.

## Project Setup and Structure

This project is broken down into different branches for each feature to make it easier to follow along with the guide. The branches are as follows:

- `main` - The main branch contains the final code for the project.
- `setup` - The setup branch contains the code for setting up the project.
- `google-maps-api` - The google-maps-api branch contains the code for creating a Google Maps API context.
